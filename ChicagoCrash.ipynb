    "\n",
    "Road safety remains a critical public health concern in major cities around the world, including Chicago. In an effort to improve traffic safety and reduce the frequency and severity of car accidents, the Chicago Department of Transportation has initiated a data-driven investigation into the primary causes of motor vehicle crashes within the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a predictive model that identifies the primary contributory cause of car accidents using data drawn from three key sources: vehicle characteristics, driver and passenger information, and environmental factors such as road conditions and weather. By analyzing these diverse datasets, the model will help uncover underlying patterns and risk factors associated with traffic accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights generated will support data-informed decision-making, enabling city officials to implement targeted safety interventions, design better infrastructure, and ultimately make Chicagoâ€™s roads safer for all users."
